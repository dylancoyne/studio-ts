## Business challenge

Ambitious project to improve the car selection and configurator journey globally with a consistent look and feel

In today's rather saturated, but extremely competitive, automobile industry, there is an increased focus on providing high level personalisation and customer satisfaction when buying a car, particularly as a car purchase is one which is not often, and is associated with luxury.

Re-design the Nissan car configurator in order to enhance customer experience as part of their Global Brand Identity redesign

In July 2020, Nissan unveiled its first new logo in 20 years alongside the launch of the Nissan Ariya, the brand's first all-electric crossover SUV. The digital World Premiere showcased Nissan’s future vision, blending the car launch with the reveal of its new identity to highlight the brand’s shift towards advanced technology and seamless customer experiences. This pivotal moment laid the foundation for creating a Global Design System, connecting Nissan’s heritage with its digital-first future.
## Strategy & Approach

**See Figma and PDF of user testing.**

Practices in the automotive industry are extremely diverse across the world, and Nissan is no exception. All solutions were designed to accommodate variations in business model, content, car culture and language across these diverse markets, while maintaining an optimum experience for all users.

Some work and been started in Australia as and A/B and was performing well to choose your car and model by a UX designer who left in a hurry with not much handover. There were design inconsistencies and user feedback proved it was difficult to find all the information users wanted to find.

Legacy back end systems meant it was hard to update and have consistency across different countries

## Results

0.1% up from old flow in months prior and up 0.3% YOY on conversion. 

We're measuring completion and conversion rates to assess overall effectiveness of the journey, while monitoring attachment rates for extras and transport options. We're also tracking the proportion of room upgrades to gauge upselling performance.

## Design evolution

The iteration cycle was intense - Friday feedback had to be explored, resolved, and implemented by Tuesday. At the same time, with direct stakeholder access, we became the conduit for relaying evolving requirements to the team, collaborating closely with developers to ensure feasibility of designs.

Early on we identified a significant limitation to our designs, content. With hotel details, room upgrades, and transfer types returned as unformatted strings or cryptic codes. Recognising the impact on user experience and business outcomes, we took a proactive approach. We crafted designs that showcased how this information could be presented optimally, demonstrating the potential to boost attachment rates for room upgrades and ancillaries.

Using this, our team developed a robust business case, quantifying the additional revenue these enhancements could generate. Through targeted workshops, we engaged with the content team, successfully conveying the importance of these updates. While immediate implementation wasn't feasible due to existing commitments, we secured a place in their 2025 roadmap.

In response, we adopted a dual-track design approach: an MVP utilising current content constraints, and a 'fast follower' version showcasing our ideal, more digestible information display. This strategy allowed us to drive the design forward within present limitations while laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

The new Virgin Holidays book flow emerged as a seamless extension of the Virgin Atlantic experience. It wasn't just a visual overhaul – we reimagined the entire journey, creating a unified platform that showcased holidays as a core Virgin Atlantic product.
