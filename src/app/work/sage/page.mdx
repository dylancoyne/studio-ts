## Business challenge

In the crowded market of cloud-based financial, HR, and business management software, security and trust are significant decision-making factors for businesses. The Sage Security Trust Hub provides a strong competitive advantage by demonstrating to potential customers that Sage places a high value on data security, compliance, and transparency.

If Sage fails to address the pain points related to customer security and privacy concerns, the company could face a variety of costly consequences that could significantly impact its revenue, brand reputation, operational efficiency, and long-term viability.

In summary, by enhancing trust and transparency in its security practices, the Sage Security Trust Hub not only mitigates risk but also acts as a revenue driver, supporting growth in both existing and new markets, reducing churn, and potentially increasing the average value per customer. This holistic approach ultimately strengthens Sage’s position in a competitive marketplace and provides a solid foundation for sustainable revenue growth.

## Strategy & Approach

The most prominent user pain points included difficulty finding clear and accessible security information, lack of transparency around certifications and compliance, concerns about data handling and privacy, and confusion around security features and settings

By following a solution framework, the project stays organized, focused on objectives, and ensures that all stakeholders are aligned throughout the website’s lifecycle. The framework also enables effective risk management, quality assurance, and scalability for the future.

In parallel, we conducted comprehensive competitor benchmarking. Allowing us to identify industry best practices, assess user expectations, and spot opportunities to differentiate our offering.

Overlapping roles and responsibilities with BA on team. Decided to divide and conquer and where overlaps were inevitable communicate through daily standups were going to happen. For user testing we would take turns taking notes or asking the questions.

Personally, I found trying to understand legalese and complex security and privacy terminology the most difficult part of the process.

Testing had to be strategic – we couldn't test everything, so we focused on the big-ticket items, gaining and actioning insights early before sharing upward.

## Results

0.1% up from old flow in months prior and up 0.3% YOY on conversion. 

We're measuring completion and conversion rates to assess overall effectiveness of the journey, while monitoring attachment rates for extras and transport options. We're also tracking the proportion of room upgrades to gauge upselling performance.

## Design evolution

The iteration cycle was intense - Friday feedback had to be explored, resolved, and implemented by Tuesday. At the same time, with direct stakeholder access, we became the conduit for relaying evolving requirements to the team, collaborating closely with developers to ensure feasibility of designs.

Early on we identified a significant limitation to our designs, content. With hotel details, room upgrades, and transfer types returned as unformatted strings or cryptic codes. Recognising the impact on user experience and business outcomes, we took a proactive approach. We crafted designs that showcased how this information could be presented optimally, demonstrating the potential to boost attachment rates for room upgrades and ancillaries.

Using this, our team developed a robust business case, quantifying the additional revenue these enhancements could generate. Through targeted workshops, we engaged with the content team, successfully conveying the importance of these updates. While immediate implementation wasn't feasible due to existing commitments, we secured a place in their 2025 roadmap.

In response, we adopted a dual-track design approach: an MVP utilising current content constraints, and a 'fast follower' version showcasing our ideal, more digestible information display. This strategy allowed us to drive the design forward within present limitations while laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

The new Virgin Holidays book flow emerged as a seamless extension of the Virgin Atlantic experience. It wasn't just a visual overhaul – we reimagined the entire journey, creating a unified platform that showcased holidays as a core Virgin Atlantic product.
